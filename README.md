# On-farm-Protocols
This repo serves two purposes:

1. As a location for all GitHub issues for on-farm trial.  The tech dashboard and Kobo forms will all have report a bug and suggest a feature buttons.  Those will be logged here.
2. As a record of final protocols used each year.  Protocols are developed in google docs for each of input from collaborators.  Final protocols each year logged here as docx files.  

Note that protocols are foundational documents that are mostly communicated via Kobo forms.  Kobo forms are developed from protocols and as such forms may contain clarifications on protocol that do not make it back to these documents. Researchers using these data should have both the protocol and the relevant Kobo forms in hand to understand the data collected.
